This is a copy of the florb tree, originally from

  https://github.com/shugaa/florb

I'm not using the full florb application, but only the slippy-map fltk widget.
Thus this is the OLD florb tree that's no longer available upstream. The sources
available upstream today are a rewrite, that's much more complex, and more
difficult to use, if you just want the widget.

===================== Upstream README =====================

florb is an OSM viewer application with GPX overlay support for the Desktop,
quite similar to the OSM slippy map in your browser.

florb is distributed under the terms of the MIT license as can be found in
LICENSE.txt.
